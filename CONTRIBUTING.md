## Contributing

If you'd like to see a plugin updated, make a pull request with your code. I will not port to X version of Minecraft or add X feature unless I feel like it.

## Resources

You will need to find a copy of the Bukkit API .jar and CraftBukkit Server .jar for your Minecraft version. Alternatively, you can make compatible .jars yourself by building [Canyon](https://github.com/canyonmodded/canyon) (CB1060 only).
