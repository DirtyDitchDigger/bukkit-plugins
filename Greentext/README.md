Implements a well-known imageboard feature into Minecraft server chat. There are no permissions or commands; it works for all players.

Supported versions: **CB798-1720 (Beta 1.5 - Release 1.1)**

Only greentext is enabled by default. You can enable or disable text colors by editing the `settings.yml` file:
* `enableGreentext` - colorize any message beginning with ">" green
* `enableRedtext` - colorize any message beginning with "<" red
* `enableYellowtext` - colorize any message ending with ">" yellow
* `enableOrangetext` - colorize any message ending with "<" orange
