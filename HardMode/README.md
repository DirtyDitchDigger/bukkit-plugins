# HardMode

Triples hostile mob damage and doubles Creeper explosion damage against players and ONLY players (PvE damage). All other damage sources, including damage between non-player entities as well as PvP damage remains the same. Armor damage reduction still works as before.

Supported versions: **CB1000-1060 (Beta 1.7.3)**

Servers for old versions of Minecraft (pre-Beta 1.8) don't have a proper difficulty switch. If monster spawning is enabled, difficulty is always set to Easy, otherwise it is set to Peaceful. This plugin attempts to remedy that by scaling mob damage, but otherwise the difficulty is still considered Easy as far as the rest of the server is concerned (in regards to fire spreading, etc).
